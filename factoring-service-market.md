<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Factoring Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recourse</li><li>Non-recourse</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Factoring services are divided into two primary market types: recourse and non-recourse factoring. In recourse factoring, the business retains some liability, meaning if a client defaults on payment, the business must repay the factor. This option often comes with lower fees due to the reduced risk for the factor. Conversely, non-recourse factoring transfers the risk to the factor, who assumes the loss if a customer defaults, typically resulting in higher fees but offering greater protection for the business.</p></p>
