<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stem cell cryopreservation equipment market is categorized into two main types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves storing stem cells in direct contact with liquid nitrogen, allowing for rapid freezing and effective preservation. In contrast, vapor phase cryopreservation utilizes nitrogen vapor above the liquid nitrogen level to store cells, offering a more gradual cooling process and reduced risk of thermal shock. Both methods aim to maintain cell viability and functionality for future therapeutic applications.</p></p>
