<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure Ventilation</li><li>Negative-pressure Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noninvasive mechanical ventilation market comprises two main types: positive-pressure ventilation and negative-pressure ventilation. Positive-pressure ventilation involves delivering air into the lungs using a mechanical device, suitable for conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or respiratory failure. In contrast, negative-pressure ventilation involves creating a vacuum around the chest to draw air into the lungs, historically used in polio treatment. Both methods aim to support patients with respiratory issues while avoiding invasive procedures.</p></p>
